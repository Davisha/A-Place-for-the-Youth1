    <p> Well my name is Davisha Bonnie and I'm 17. I live in          the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda and I                recently attended the antigua Girls High School. I            never really thought about engaging in my community           much, it was just a thought in the back of my head.           This course gave me the courage to try to make a              difference on a topic that I know may countries among         mine struggle with.  </p>

    <a id="2"> <h2> The Problem </h2> </a>
    
    <p> Over the years I've noticed that the youth of my     
        community are losing their way. More and more kids            around my age have no where to hangout and just be            kids. Many of them have turn to drug use and violence         and I believe that together we can change that for a          better future. I've decided that I can't sit back and         watch anymore, It's time for us all to take action. </p>

   <a id="4"> <h2> What's the plan? </h2> </a>
    <p> The plan's to start an organization just for kids.            I want to start all sorts of clubs for cooking,               sports, art, music and many more. We'll first raise           funds to build a community center just for this               organization, then we can bring in professionals in           different fields who can teach the kids. It dosn't            have to end in Antigua and Barbuda, why should it             when there's the entire Caribbean and lots more. This         can go so far and reach so many more kids                     worldwide just like me. Just think about how far these kids could go. As for the organization itself lets call it <b>A Place for the Youth!</b>
